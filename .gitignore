.idea

# Recursively matches any file ending with class at any depth under current directory (i.e., "/")
**/*.class

# NOTES

# 1. The double star ("**") selects all folders within the current folder, with the current folder being the directory where .gitignore is located

# 2. The single star ("*") selects everything in current folder, with the current folder being the directory where .gitignore is located

# 3. An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again
